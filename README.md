# poc-addon-minecraft

Proof of concept: create a single working Minecraft Bedrock Edition addon — one custom item with its own texture and behavior — that can be installed and used in-game.

## Purpose

The Everything Addon website promises customizable Minecraft Bedrock Edition addons. Before investing in the storefront, we need to validate that we can produce the core product. If this works, it becomes the first real item in the catalog.

## Goal

- One custom item with custom texture and behavior
- Packaged as a valid `.mcaddon` file
- Installable and functional in Minecraft Bedrock Edition
